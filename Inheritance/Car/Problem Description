Given a class Car , create two classes 'BMW' and 'Honda' with following characteristics

BMW class should have private property alloyWheels of integer type.
Honda class should have private property normalWheels of integer type.
Both BMW and Honda are inherited from 'Car' class.
Both classes should implement setData which will set model, the color of super class and wheel count.
BMW class should implement "getAlloyWheelCount" to return count of alloyWheels;
Honda class should implement "getNormalWheelCount" to return count of normalWheels;
 

Input
    BMW1Series5-door Red 4
    i-VTECS1497 Black 6

 

    where,

First line of input is a model, color, alloyWheels of BMW separated by space.
Second line of input is a model, color and normalWheels count of Honda separated by space.
 

Output
    BMW1Series5-door Red 4
    i-VTECS1497 Black 6

 

    where,

First line is a model, color and alloyWheels count of BMW separated by space.
Second line is a model, color and normalWheels count of Honda separated by space.
 

Assume:

Wheel counts for both cars are integers within the range [1 to 20].
