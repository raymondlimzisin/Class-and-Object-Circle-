Problem Description

A class named Rectangle is defined as follows.

Private instance variables named width and height that represents the width and height of the rectangle.
The constructor Rectangle()that initialised width and height to 0.0 respectively.
setWidth(double) method to set a new width
setHeight(double) method to set a new height
getWidth() method that returns the width
getHeight() method that returns the height
getArea() method that returns the area of the rectangle.
getPerimeter() method to returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
 

The UML Class Diagram for class Rectangle is as the following.

Rectangle
-width: double

-height: double

+Rectangle()

+setWidth(width:double): void

+setHeight(height:double): void

+getWidth(): double

+getHeight(): double

+getArea(): double

+getPerimeter(): double

 

Write the code for the Rectangle class and a test program named RectangleaApp that reads the input and prints the output as described below.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) which determines the number of test cases. Each of the following n lines contains two positive real numbers w and h (0.0 ≤ w, h ≤ 500.00) which represents the width and height of the rectangle.

 

Output

For each test case, the output contains a line in the format "Case #x: ", where x is the case number (starting from 1) follows by the width, height, area, and perimeter of the rectangle. (format the output in 2 decimal places).
